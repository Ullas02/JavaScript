// Introduction to variables

let a = "car" // here 'a' is variable name which holds the data "car" in it
let b = 85 // here 'b' is variable name which holds the data 85 in it

var c = "bike"

console.log(a)
console.log(b)
console.log(c)

// let 8name = "arun" // throws an error as it violates the variable name condition, the variable name should not start with a number.
